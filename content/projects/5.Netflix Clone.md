## What is Netflix Clone?

Netflix Clone is a pixel-perfect UI clone of Netflix I made using React and Tailwind CSS.

## Why Did You Build It?

I built this project to better understand how to build modern frontend systems using React. I wanted to see if I could recreate a simple yet pixel-perfect version of a popular web app, and I ended up choosing Netflix. The main challenge came from trying to emulate the different interactions and micro-interactions on Netflix such as smooth side-scrolling and scaling title cards on hover.

## How Did You Build It?

I kept the tools I used in this project to a minimum. The goal was to challenge myself on different aspects of creating a delightful frontend experience without relying heavily on third-party dependencies. I used React to create dynamic, reusable components, Tailwind CSS for styling and Vite as my build tool.
