    <p>
      Hello! My name is Dawit ðŸ‘‹. I craft web interfaces that are
      <em>delightful</em> and <em>accessible</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      My interest in web development started back in 2016 when I came across the
      web development community on Instagram. I developed a keen interest and
      started to learn more about it from sources like Codecademy and W3Schools.

      alt="A screenshot of searching on google 'where to write code'"
      class="w-full object-cover rounded-lg my-4"
    />
    <p>
      This ultimately influenced my decision to pursue a Computer Science
      degree.
    </p>
    <p>
      While building a strong technical foundation in college, I dedicated a lot
      of my free time teaching myself web development and building things out.
    </p>
    <p>
      My <em>design-oriented</em> approach ensures that every project I touch is
      as aesthetically pleasing as it is accessible and functional. Some of my
      projects receive hundreds of monthly visits.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am currently seeking opportunities to share my passion and expertise.
